## Abstract
The goal of our project is to conduct a Supervised Lung Cancer Classification Experiment to detect the presence of cancer in human lungs from Normal, Adenocarcinoma, Large Cell Carcinoma, and Squamous Cell Carcinoma images. Our primary aim is to execute a classification algorithm on image data of CT scans. We will train and test at least 4 different models on the
data set and assess their performance via various visualization methods and statistical analyses. 

## Data Set 

#### 1. Chest CT-Scan Images Dataset
###### Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedhanyyy/chest-ctscan-images
###### Size: 1000 Images Split Into: 70% Train, 20% Test, 10% Validation
###### Variables: Label (Cancer/NonCancer), Image Dimensions, Width, Channel (Unimportant)
###### Limitations: Data comes in various file types (12 .jpg, 988 .png), small set
###### Contains train, test, and validation directory each containing a subdirectory of different chest cancer types (carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma) and 1 subdirectory of normal CT-Scan images
