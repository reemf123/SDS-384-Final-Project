### Abstract
The goal of our project is to conduct Supervised Lung Nodule Exploratory Analysis. 
The first aim of our problem set up is to execute a binary classification of the presence or absence of nodules in Lung CT Scans. We will train and test at least 4 different classification algorithms on CT scans provided to us by the LUNA 16 DataSet. We will acess the performance of each classification method via various vizulization methods and statiscal scores. Then, our hope is to test the strongest binary classification algorithm on Lung CT scans containing tumors rather than nodules. Via our teammates research labratory, we have over 30 Lung CT scans, some of which contain tumors. The source of this data set is The Dynamic Medical Image and Computing (DMIC) Lab repository. We would like to determine whether the algorithm we develop to classfify the presence of Lung Nodules can be extended to Lung Tumors. The second aim of our project set up is to perform supervised tumor im... 


### Data Sets: 
#### 1. LUNA 16 from LIDC/IDRI Database
Source: https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/Download/
Size: 888 CT Scans (Contains 1,186 nodules annotated collected by 4 experienced radiologists)
Variables: Candidate ID, x/y/z position of nodule, class label (0 for non-nodule/1 for nodule)
Limitations: 


#### 2. Research CT Scans from Team Memberâ€™s Laboratory Research 

Source: The Dynamic Medical Image and Computing (DMIC) Lab repository
Size: 30 CT Scans (8 Annotated Scans)
Variables: Class Label (0 for no tumor/1 for tumor), radiation treatment
Limitations: Small Data Set, Inconsistent Imaging Artifact in Scans, Few annotations collected by biomedical engineering undergraduate students
